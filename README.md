# VignereCipher
This project is an text-based encryption algorithm that implements the laws of the Vignere cipher. It was created as an attempt to better understand 
the Vignere ciphering process. The project was implemented by creating two dictionaries, one which tracks the place value of alphabetical characters, and another that 
contains reverse values. In addition, methods were created to find given values within these dictionaries based on whether you were looking for the numerical value of a character or a
numerical value's corresponding charcter. Using these mehtods, an encryption algorithm was created that, given plaintext and a key, would encode said plaintext using the
laws of Vignere cipher. The end result is a program that does exactly that, also taking into account that the key does not have to be the same length as the plaintext.
